Detailed description:
<br/>
I need a grocery system application using Java with clean UI to add, update, delete the items. It should perform crud operations from sql database. I should be able to add images for each item.
It should use the following concepts like:
OOP- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
File Input/Output
Arrays,

It should have sort and search functionality.
